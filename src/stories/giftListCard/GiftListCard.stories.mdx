# Gift list card

This component integrates the more atomic one to create a gift list card that has mainly 2 functions

- Display the data he receives, it does it in a consistent way keeping a cohesive design
- Executes an action he receives when it get's clicked

Visually when hovered changes the background color and border into a purple and when it's
active gets a "push button" effect.
It's very responsive and works in all devices.

Semantically this is a button because when clicked will execute and action and
in that way helps text readers know that it's a clickable element
